## Tutorial: Git Installation and Configuration

### Step 1: Installing Git

If Git is not yet installed on your system, you can follow these steps to install it.

1. Open the official Git website [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Select the appropriate operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and download the appropriate installer.
3. Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.
4. As an addition, don't forget to check "Git Credential Manager Core" to ease Git integration with GitHub.

![Git Credential Manager Core option image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5658207/140082529-1ac133c1-0922-4a24-af03-067e27b3988b.png)

### Step 2: Initial Git Configuration

After Git is installed, the following steps will help you set up the initial configuration before starting to use Git.

1. Create a new folder/directory to store your Git project, then enter that directory.
2. Copy the path to the directory you created.
3. Open the terminal or command prompt on your system, then move to the directory you created by running the command `cd <directory_path>`
4. Initialize a new repository with the `git init` command. This command will create an empty Git repository inside the directory you specified.

### Step 3: Configuring Username and Email

Before starting to contribute to the repository, configure your username and email address to be associated with your commits.

Set the username and email that will be associated with your work to this Git repository by running the commands below. Adjust with the username and email you use on [GitHub](https://github.com).

```bash
git config --global user.name "<NAME>"
git config --global user.email "<EMAIL>"
```

Example:

```bash
git config --global user.name "pakbepe"
git config --global user.email "pak.bepe@cs.ui.ac.id"
```

Note that the `--global` flag will change the global configuration for the entire system. What global configuration means is you're telling Git: "Whenever I use Git on this computer, consider my name and email to always be this."

So:
`--global` = applies to all Git projects you open on that computer.

:::warning
- Make sure to replace `<NAME>` and `<EMAIL>` with your personal information
- If you **only need internal configuration** you only need to use this code 

```bash
git config user.name "<NAME>"
git config user.email "<EMAIL>"
```

Example:

```bash
git config user.name "pakbepe"
git config user.email "pak.bepe@cs.ui.ac.id"
```

- Internal configuration means the name and email you use for login only applies to the current Git project you're working on. So only for the Git folder you're currently active in (for example: 1 project only).
:::

### Step 4: Authentication Configuration

To later connect your Git account with your GitHub account, there are extra configurations you need to add. You just need to run both commands below:

**Windows**
```bash
git credential-manager configure
git config --global credential.credentialStore wincredman
```

**Unix (macOS, Linux)**
```bash
git credential-manager configure
git config --global credential.credentialStore keychain
```

:::tip
- If the `git credential-manager` command cannot be executed, you can try the `git-credential-manager` or `git-credential-manager-core` command.
- On macOS, if both commands don't work, you can try downloading git credential manager using *Homebrew* with the command `brew install git-credential-manager-core`.
- If macOS doesn't have *Homebrew*, you can download it by following the instructions from [this website](https://brew.sh).
:::

### Step 5: Configuration Verification

To ensure the configuration has been set correctly in the local repository, you can run the following command.

```bash
git config --list
```

## Tutorial: Basic Git Usage

A **repository** is a storage place for software projects, which includes all revisions and changes that have been made to the code. To execute Git commands, you can do so on repositories on GitHub, a collaborative platform for managing projects using Git.

:::info
You need to know that this basic Git usage tutorial will not be submitted and is only for practice. The file you will submit is only the Django project, the steps for creating which are also included in this tutorial.
:::

### Step 1: Initiating a Repository on GitHub

The first step in using Git is to initiate a repository on GitHub to start tracking changes to your project.

1. Open [GitHub](https://github.com) through a web browser.

2. Create a New Repository
	- On the GitHub homepage, create a new repository named `my-first-repo`.
	- Open the page of the repository you just created. Make sure to set the project visibility as "Public" and leave other settings at default values.

3. Determine Local Directory
	- Choose a local directory on your computer that has been initialized with Git. This is where you will store the local version of your project.

4. Add README.md File
	- Create a new file named `README.md` in your project's local directory.
	- Fill the README.md file with information such as name, student ID, and class. Example:
    ```md
    Name: Pak Bepe
    Student ID: 2401234567
    Class: PBP A
    ```

5. Check Status and Perform Tracking
	- Open command prompt or terminal, then run `git status` in the directory you have chosen. This command will display files that are not yet tracked (untracked).
	- Use the `git add README.md` command to mark the README.md file as a file to be committed (tracked).

6. Commit Changes
	- Run `git status` again and make sure the README.md file is already marked as a file to be committed.
	- Continue by running `git commit -m "<YOUR COMMENT>"` to create a commit with a comment message appropriate to the changes you made.

:::warning
This step will prepare you to start tracking changes to your project using Git.
:::
:::info
- **Good practice** in giving commit comments is to briefly explain what you did. Generally, commit comments are written in English. One example of a commit comment you can use for the example above is `Create README.md file`.
- Good commit comments can help you and your team members understand the purpose of those changes.
- **Avoid** comments that are too general or ambiguous, such as `Fix bugs` or `Update file`.
:::

### Step 2: Connecting Local Repository with Repository on GitHub

After initiating a local repository, the next step is to connect it with a repository on GitHub so you can collaborate and store changes on that online platform.

1. Create New **Main Branch**
	- In the terminal or command prompt, run the `git branch -M main` command to create a new main branch named "main".
	- Make sure the letter "M" in the -M command is written in **capital letters**.

2. Connect with Repository on GitHub
    - Use the `git remote add <REMOTE_NAME> <REPO_URL>` command to connect the local repository with the repository on GitHub.  
    - `<REMOTE_NAME>` is the name you will use to reference that remote repository. By convention, the name `origin` is used for the main/primary repository.
    - `<REPO_URL>` is the HTTPS URL of the repository you created on GitHub.
    - You can get this repository URL on the GitHub page when you successfully create a new repository on GitHub.
    
    Usage example:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/pakbepe/test.git
    ```
    
    In the example above:
    - origin = remote name (can be replaced with another name if desired)
    - https://github.com/pakbepe/test.git = GitHub repository URL

    Additional Tips:
    - To see the list of remotes that have been added: `git remote -v`
    - To remove remote: `git remote remove <REMOTE_NAME>`
    - To change remote URL: `git remote set-url <REMOTE_NAME> <NEW_URL>`
    
3. Perform First Save to GitHub
	- Finally, perform the first save to GitHub by running the `git push -u origin main` command.
	- This command will send all changes in the current branch (in this case the main branch) in the local repository to the main branch in the GitHub repository.
	- If this is your first time pushing to GitHub and you're using Windows OS, after installation, a window should appear asking you to sign in to GitHub. Click "Sign in with your browser", then follow the instructions in that window.

4. Perform Re-checking
	- Refresh your repository page, your README.md file should now be visible.

:::info
- This step is important to maintain consistency between local repositories and repositories on GitHub.
- This process allows you to start collaborating and storing project changes in a structured way on the GitHub platform.
- README.md is a file that contains a brief explanation of the project, such as its purpose, how to run it, and its main features, so that others can easily understand and use the project.
- More information about **git master / main** and its branching can be seen [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches).
:::

### Step 3: Cloning a Repository

**Cloning a repository** is the process of duplicating the entire content from a repository on GitHub to a local computer so it can be viewed, edited, and run offline on your computer. The steps are as follows.

1. Open the repository page on [GitHub](https://github.com) that you created earlier.

2. Copy Clone URL
	- Click the **Code** button in the upper right corner of the repository page on GitHub.
	- Choose the HTTPS option to copy the clone URL.

3. Clone Repository to Local Computer
	- Open terminal or command prompt in a directory **different** from where your previous local repository was.
	- Run the `git clone <CLONE_URL>` command (replace CLONE_URL with the URL you copied).
	- This command will duplicate the entire repository to your local computer.

Currently, you have three repositories:

1. **Original repository** on local computer.
2. **Online repository** on GitHub connected to the local repository.
3. **New repository resulting from the cloning process** connected to the GitHub repository.

:::info
This step allows you to work with repositories in various places easily.
:::

### Step 4: Branching on a Repository

At this stage you will learn about using branches in Git. Using branches allows you to develop features or fix bugs in a separate environment before merging them back to the main branch.

**What Is a Branch in Git?**

- A branch in Git is a separate branch of source code that allows independent development of features or changes.
- This allows teams to work on features or bug fixes without disturbing the existing code in the main branch.

1. Creating and Switching to New Branch
	- In the original local repository directory (not the clone), run the `git checkout -b <BRANCH_NAME>` command in terminal or command prompt to create and switch to a new branch. Example: `git checkout -b major_branch`
	- Add a major attribute to the README.md file. Example:
    ```md
    Name: Pak Bepe
    Student ID: 2401234567
    Class: PBP A
    Hobby: Sleeping
    Major: Computer Science Information Systems
    ```

2. Save Changes and Push to GitHub
	- After adding the major attribute, save that file.
	- Perform add, commit, and push to GitHub by running the commands you have mastered before.
	- Run the `git push -u origin <BRANCH_NAME>` command. Make sure to replace `<BRANCH_NAME>` according to the name of the new branch that has been created.

3. Merge Branches Using Pull Request

	- Open your repository page on GitHub again.
	- Automatically, a pop-up with the **Compare & pull request** button will appear. If not, the alternative is to press the **Pull Request** button and then select the **New pull request** option.
	- After that, GitHub will compare the changes in both branches that want to be merged.
	- If there are no conflicts, press the **Merge pull request** button which will merge changes from the branch you want to merge into the main branch (main).
	- **If there are conflicts**, you must look at the file that is usually red in your text editor and resolve the conflict by choosing merge or one of them according to needs before approving the **Merge pull request**.
	- By doing the steps above, all changes from both branches will be integrated into the main branch, creating unity between those changes.

:::info
- If you want to switch between existing branches, run `git checkout <BRANCH_NAME>` in terminal. The `-b` flag in the previous commands is used to create a new branch and switch to that branch in one step.
- **Conflicts** occur when changes made on one branch collide with changes made on another branch. For example, if two developers change the same part of the same file at the same time, Git cannot automatically decide which changes should be applied.
- If there are conflicts or changes that collide with each other, this platform will ask you to determine which changes should be taken.
- **Important** to understand the concept of branching in Git, because this allows **organized and separate development**, before all changes are combined back into the main code.

## Tutorial: Django Installation and Django Project Initialization

**Django** is a popular framework for developing web applications using the Python programming language. In this tutorial, you will learn the steps to install Django and initialize a demo project as a starter.

:::warning
This Django project must be created in a folder that will be referred to as a **directory** different from `my-first-repo` as taught in the previous steps. Make sure you have changed directories in the terminal and are no longer inside `my-first-repo`.

To change directories please use this code
```bash
cd ~
mkdir <NEW_FOLDER_NAME>
cd <NEW_FOLDER_NAME>
```

Notes: 
- mkdir functions to create a new folder
- cd functions to change folders
- cd ~ functions to change to the main folder on your computer
:::

### Step 1: Creating Directory and Activating Virtual Environment

1. Create a new directory named `football-news` and enter it.
2. Inside that directory, open command prompt (Windows) or terminal shell (Unix).
3. Create a virtual environment by running the following command.

	Windows:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    ```

	Unix (macOS, Linux):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    ```

4. This **virtual environment** is useful for isolating packages and dependencies from applications so they don't clash with other versions on your computer. You can activate the virtual environment with the following command.

	- Windows:
    ```bash
    env\Scripts\activate
    ```
  
	- Unix (Mac/Linux):
    ```bash
    source env/bin/activate
    ```
	
	:::tip
	For Windows users, if you experience problems with words PSSecurityException, UnauthorizedAccess, running scripts is disabled on this system, do the following steps.
	1. Open PowerShell with administrator access.
	2. Run the `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force` command.
	3. Please try again to activate the virtual environment in your terminal.
	:::

5. The virtual environment will be active and marked with (env) in the terminal input line.

### Step 2: Preparing Dependencies and Creating Django Project

**Dependencies** are components or modules required by software to function, including libraries, frameworks, or packages. This allows developers to utilize existing code, speeding up development, but also requires careful management to ensure proper version compatibility. Using virtual environments helps isolate dependencies between different projects.

1. In the same directory, create a requirements.txt file and add some dependencies.
    ```text
    django
    gunicorn
    whitenoise
    psycopg2-binary
    requests
    urllib3
    python-dotenv
    ```

2. Install the existing dependencies with the following command. Don't forget to run the virtual environment first before running the following command.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Create a Django project named `football_news` with the following command.
    ```bash
    django-admin startproject football_news .
    ```

	:::warning
	Make sure the . character is written at the end of the command.
	:::

### Step 3: Environment Variables and Project Configuration

1. Create a .env file in the root project directory (where the manage.py file is located).

   ![image](/img/t0-1.png)

2. Open the .env file and add the following configuration:
   
    ```env
    PRODUCTION=False
    ```
   
   **Environment variables** are variables stored outside the program code and used to store configuration information such as database credentials, API keys, or environment settings. This allows the same code to run in different environments without needing to change the code.

3. Also create a .env.prod file in the same directory for production configuration:
   
    ```env
    DB_NAME=<database name>
    DB_HOST=<database host>
    DB_PORT=<database port>
    DB_USER=<database username>
    DB_PASSWORD=<database password>
    SCHEMA=tutorial
    PRODUCTION=True
    ```
   
   **Difference between .env and .env.prod:**
   - **.env**: Used for local development. Because PRODUCTION=False, the application will use a simpler SQLite database for testing and development
   - **.env.prod**: Used for production deployment. Because PRODUCTION=True, the application will use PostgreSQL database with credentials provided by ITF Fasilkom UI
   
   **Database credentials** for variables DB_NAME, DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD can be obtained from the ITF Fasilkom UI email (noreply@cs.ui.ac.id) sent to you. These credentials will be used when deploying on PWS.
   
   :::info
   **Explanation of each variable:**
   - DB_NAME: PostgreSQL database name
   - DB_HOST: Database server host/address
   - DB_PORT: Database connection port
   - DB_USER: Username for database connection
   - DB_PASSWORD: Password for database connection
   - SCHEMA: Database schema name. ITF provides 3 schemas: tutorial, tugas_individu, and tugas_kelompok. For this tutorial we use tutorial, for other assignments adjust according to the required schema
   - PRODUCTION: Determines application mode (False = development with SQLite, True = production with PostgreSQL)
   :::
   
   **Example .env.prod configuration:** 
    ```env
    DB_NAME=d1a2b3c4d5e6f7
    DB_HOST=192.168.1.100
    DB_PORT=5432
    DB_USER=postgres
    DB_PASSWORD=ABCdef123456
    SCHEMA=tutorial
    PRODUCTION=True
    ```

4. Modify the settings.py file to use environment variables. Add the following code at the top of the file (after import Path):
   
    ```python
    import os
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    # Load environment variables from .env file
    load_dotenv()
    ```

5. Add both strings below to ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py for development purposes:
   
    ```python
    ...
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["localhost", "127.0.0.1"]
    ...
    ```
   
   In the context of deployment, ALLOWED_HOSTS functions as a list of hosts allowed to access the web application. By setting the above values, you allow access from local hosts, meaning it can only be accessed from your network only. However, if you deploy the application to a server, make sure you add the host from that server to ALLOWED_HOSTS.

6. Add the `PRODUCTION` configuration right above the `DEBUG` code in `settings.py`.
   
    ```python
   PRODUCTION = os.getenv('PRODUCTION', 'False').lower() == 'true'
   ```

7. Change the database configuration in settings.py. Find the DATABASES section and replace with:
   
    ```python
    # Database configuration
    if PRODUCTION:
        # Production: use PostgreSQL with credentials from environment variables
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
                'NAME': os.getenv('DB_NAME'),
                'USER': os.getenv('DB_USER'),
                'PASSWORD': os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD'),
                'HOST': os.getenv('DB_HOST'),
                'PORT': os.getenv('DB_PORT'),
                'OPTIONS': {
                    'options': f"-c search_path={os.getenv('SCHEMA', 'public')}"
                }
            }
        }
    else:
        # Development: use SQLite
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
            }
        }
    ```

### Step 4: Running the Server

1. Make sure the manage.py file exists in the directory currently active in your terminal. Run database migration first with the command:
	- Windows:	
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

	- Unix:	
    ```bash
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```

2. After migration is complete, run the Django server with the command:
	- Windows:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
	- Unix:	
    ```bash
    python3 manage.py runserver
    ```

3. Open http://localhost:8000 in a web browser to see the rocket animation as a sign that your Django application has been successfully created.
![image](/img/t0-2.png)

### Step 5: Stopping Server and Deactivating Virtual Environment

1. To stop the server, press `Ctrl+C` (Windows/Linux) or `Control+C` (Mac) in the terminal.
2. Deactivate the virtual environment with the command:
    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

   	**Congratulations! You have successfully created a Django application from scratch.**
    
## Tutorial: Upload Project to GitHub Repository
1. Create a new GitHub repository named `football-news` with public visibility.

2. Initialize the local football-news directory as a Git repository.
	:::tip
	Remember the previous tutorial steps. Also make sure you run the `git init` command in the football-news directory, not outside it or in another directory inside football-news.
	:::
	Run the following command in the terminal:
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

    This command creates a .git folder used to track file changes locally.
3. Add `.gitignore` file
   	- Add a `.gitignore` file and fill that file with the following text.

    ```yaml
    # Django
    *.log
    *.pot
    *.pyc
    **pycache**
    db.sqlite3

	- The `.gitignore` file is a configuration file used in Git repositories to determine files and directories that should be ignored by Git.
	- Files listed in `.gitignore` will **not** be included in Git version control (not pushed to GitHub repository).
	- This file needs to be created because sometimes there are files that don't need to be tracked by Git, such as files generated by compilation processes, temporary files, or personal configuration files.

4. Connect local repository with the GitHub repository that has been created.
	
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/username/football-news.git
    ```

	*Replace username with your GitHub username.*
	
	This command adds a remote named origin that points to your GitHub repository. By adding this remote, Git will know where to send your code when pushing.

5. Create main branch named master.
	
    ```bash
    git branch -M master
    ```

6. Perform add, commit, and push from the local repository directory.
	
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Tutorial 0"
    git push origin master
    ```

:::info
- The **football-news** repository you just created will be the foundation for the following tutorials. **This repository will continue to be used** and developed throughout the tutorials you follow.
- At the end of the semester, you will see that this tutorial repository has developed into a complete application, made by yourself. So, you might include this in your portfolio!
- Therefore, make sure you manage this repository well and follow the next tutorials to develop your skills in platform-based programming.

## Tutorial: Creating Account and Deployment through PWS (Pacil Web Service)
1. Access the PWS page at https://pbp.cs.ui.ac.id. You will be directed to the login page.
![Login PWS](/img/t0-3.png)
2. Access the register page by clicking the Register Here button. On this page, please fill in your data as requested.

3. After the registration process is complete, you can return to the login page. Please enter the username and password you just registered, then login.

4. If the login process is successful, you will be directed to the home page of PWS.

    ![Home PWS](/img/t0-4.png)

5. Create a new project by pressing the Create New Project button. You will be directed to the page for creating a new project. On this page, fill in Project Name with `footballnews`. After that, press Create New Project below it.

	![PWS Create Project page](/img/t0-5.png)

	:::info
	In creating other projects later such as assignments or group projects, you can fill in Project Name with other names as you wish. However, there is a limitation that the project name must consist of alphanumeric characters only.
	:::

6. Two new pieces of information will appear, namely Project Credentials and Project Command. **Save the credentials you obtained** in a safe place, because henceforth these credentials **will not be visible again**. **Don't run the Project Command instructions yet**.
    
    ![image](/img/t0-6.png)

7. Then, on the sidebar, click the project you created. Select the Environment tab. 
![image](/img/t0-7.png)
    On that tab, click Raw Editor and copy paste the contents of the **.env.prod** file you previously created.
![image](/img/t0-8.png)
Don't forget to make sure that `SCHEMA=tutorial` and `PRODUCTION=True`, then click Update All Variables. Next make sure that the environment variables in your PWS project have been saved properly.
![image](/img/t0-9.png)

8. In the `settings.py` file of the Django project you created earlier, add the PWS deployment URL to ALLOWED_HOSTS.
	:::info
	The PWS deployment URL has the format `<username-sso>-<project name>.pbp.cs.ui.ac.id`. If there is a dot character (.) in your SSO username, replace that character with a hyphen (-). For example, if your SSO username is `pak.bepe25` and your project name is `footballnews`, your PWS deployment URL is `pak-bepe25-footballnews.pbp.cs.ui.ac.id`.
	:::
	
    ```python
    ...
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["localhost", "127.0.0.1", "<Your PWS deployment URL>"]
    ...
    ```

	You need to do this step so that your Django project can be accessed through the PWS *deployment* URL. Perform `git add`, `commit`, and `push` these changes to your GitHub repository.
	:::warning
	Before you go to the next step, make sure your repository structure is the same as ![image](/img/t0-10.png)
	:::

9. Run the command found in the Project Command information on the PWS page. When you push to PWS, there will be a window asking for `username` and `password`. Use the credentials you received from your tutorial project in PWS, **not SSO credentials**.
![image](/img/t0-11.png)

10. On the PWS site sidebar, click the project you created. You can see your current deployment status. If the status is `Building`, it means your project is still in the deployment process. If the status is `Running`, then your project can already be accessed on the deployment URL. You can press the `View Project` button found on your project page.

11. If in the future there are changes to your Django project that you want to push to PWS, you only need to run the command:
	
    ```bash
    git push pws master
    ```

	**after doing add and commit**. You don't need to repeat the commands in the Project Command information again.

## Additional: PWS Troubleshooting

### Build Failed 
If there are problems such as failed builds, there are several solutions you can try.

- Try to pay attention again to the structure of your Django project files. Usually indicates that the files in your Django project are incomplete, so your Django project is not detected by PWS. There are several things you can try to check:
	- Repository Contents: Make sure your repository structure is the same as the example repository display shown in step 7 in the PWS deployment tutorial section.
	- `requirements.txt` file: Make sure the file name is exactly the same, not `requirement.txt` (missing letter 's') or `requirements.txt.txt` (double extension)
	- `.gitignore` file: Make sure the `.gitignore` file starts with a dot and has no extension at the end. Also make sure the `.gitignore` file is located in the root folder along with the `manage.py` file, `env` directory, `footballnews` directory, `requirements.txt` file, hidden `.git` directory, and `db.sqlite3` database file.
	:::tip
	If you are a Windows user, check the `File name extensions` option in Windows Explorer to see the extensions of the files you have. With this, you can do troubleshooting more easily.
    
	    ![file extension](/img/t0-15.png)

	:::
	- Make sure the `env` directory and `db.sqlite3` database file are not tracked/not pushed by Git. If it has already happened, you can add a `.gitignore` file, then run the `git rm --cached -r env db.sqlite3` command before doing `add`, `commit`, and `push`. This needs to be done so that the `env` directory and `db.sqlite3` file are no longer tracked by Git.
    - If you are sure that your Django project file structure is complete but deployment still fails, make sure you push to PWS using the `master` branch.

### Not Saving Credentials

If you forget to save the credentials you got when creating a project in PWS, what you can do is regenerate the credential on the Settings tab in that project. 
![image](/img/t0-16.png)

Don't forget to follow the steps explained on that tab. Another solution is to create a new project.

### Changing PWS Remote URL in Local Repository

If you create a new project in PWS to overcome problems in the previous project, you need to change the remote URL in your local repository to the remote URL from the new project. If you don't change it, then the `git push pws master` command you will run later will not push to your new project, but will still try to push to your old project.

To change the remote URL, you just need to change the first command found in the new PWS project display. Change the `git remote add pws <link>` command to `git remote set-url pws <link>`, then run the subsequent commands as usual.

### Error 502 (Bad Gateway) on web

During the first deployment, you might see a 502 (Bad Gateway) error in the browser. This is normal because PWS is running the database migration process before the application server (gunicorn) is ready to receive requests.
![image](/img/t0-17.png)

You can check the progress in the Logs tab on the PWS project dashboard. Wait until the Listening at log appears (usually 15-20 seconds). Since logs don't update via streaming, refresh the log page if necessary.

![image](/img/t0-18.png)

### Error 400 (Bad Request) on web

Error 400 (Bad Request) usually occurs because your PWS deployment domain has not been added to ALLOWED_HOSTS in the `settings.py` file.

## Final Words

Congratulations! You have completed the tutorial on using Git, GitHub, IDE installation, Django project development, and deployment to PWS!

Additional message, make sure you understand every code you write. **Don't just copy-paste without understanding it first.** If you experience difficulties later, don't hesitate to ask teaching assistants or friends. Keep up the spirit in taking PBP courses for the next semester, and don't forget to enjoy every process. Good luck!
