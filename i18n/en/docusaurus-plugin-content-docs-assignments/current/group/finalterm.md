# Final Semester Project

**Creating a Mobile Application using Flutter Framework (Group Work)**
Release Date: November 17, 2025, 12:00 PM WIB

---

## Specific Learning Objectives

1. Implement a simple mobile application with Flutter framework
2. Apply widgets for layout and input, event handling, and asynchronous calls to web services
3. Deploy the application on the Bitrise platform

## General Rules for Group Assignment

1. One group only needs to create one GitHub repository to be used by all group members for collaboration. Submit the GitHub repository link to Scele.
:::info
**Notes** 
For those who have already used an organization in previous assignments, you can simply add a new repository to that organization. 

**Make sure the Django website repository is different from the Flutter/application repository**.
:::
2. The GitHub repository must contain a `README.md` that includes:
    - List of group member names
    - APK link (Not required for Stage I. The APK link can be added to the `README.md` later after completing Stage II.) 
    - Application description (name and function of the application)
    - List of implemented modules along with work distribution per member
    - User roles or actors of the application 
    - **Explanation of the data integration flow in the application with the web application (PWS) created during the Mid-Semester Project based on web service.**
    - Figma Design Link
    
3. Application deployment:
    - Upload APK as a Release on the group's GitHub and platforms like Bitrise. 
    - **Use your own group's application logo**

## Specific Rules per Group Member (Module Implementation)

1. Apply widgets for layout and input (Material/Cupertino, according to each group's integration) 
2. Apply event handling
3. Apply **asynchronous calls** to Django web service (the web application created during the Mid-Semester Project)
4. Process JSON response data from Django web service and display the results in the mobile application

Make sure you also check the assessment components in [BRP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ymxsq-t7aNcrsCgwFLrFkbUWVb5f4rZh/edit) for reference on what will be assessed individually and as a group.

**Additional Notes**: 
The teaching assistant team highly recommends synchronization in both the application's color theme and other aspects between the website and the application. The Bitrise usage tutorial has been included in Lab 9. 

During the demo, you will open your PWS along with your application, where your website data will be tested to see if it is already integrated in real-time with the application you created for this assignment.

**The demo will be conducted with teaching assistants and instructors, so give your best effort!**

**TIPS**
The promotional video should ideally be 1 video that covers both web and mobile app promotion because this video will be displayed on the PBP website if you become one of the awardees in any category.

:::danger
**About deadline extension**: The Instructor Team and Teaching Assistant Team have agreed not to provide deadline extensions for the Final Semester Project, so please manage your team's time accordingly. Requests for Final Semester Project deadline extensions will be rejected because **this information has been announced since the Final Semester Project was released**.
