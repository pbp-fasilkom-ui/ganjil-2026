# Assignment 3: Forms and Data Delivery Implementation in Django

Platform-Based Programming (CSGE602022) â€” Organized by the Faculty of Computer Science Universitas Indonesia, Odd Semester 2025/2026

---

## Assignment Description

In this assignment, you will implement data delivery and apply several concepts you have learned during the tutorial session.

## Assignment Checklist

The checklist for this assignment is as follows:
- [ ] Add 4 new `views` functions to view the added objects in XML, JSON, XML by ID, and JSON by ID formats.
- [ ] Create URL routings for each of the `views` added in point 1.
- [ ] Create a webpage to display the model object data with an "Add" button that redirects to the `form` page, and a "Detail" button on each model object data that displays the object's detail page.
- [ ] Create a `form` page to add model objects to the previous app.
- [ ] Create a webpage that displays the details of each model object data. 
- [ ] Answer the following questions in the `README.md` file in the root folder. 
    - [ ] Why do we need data delivery in implementing a platform?
    - [ ] In your opinion, which is better, XML or JSON? Why is JSON more popular than XML?
    - [ ] What is the purpose of the `is_valid()` method in Django forms, and why do we need it?
    - [ ] Why do we need a `csrf_token` when making forms in Django? What can happen if we don't include a `csrf_token` in a Django form? How can this be exploited by an attacker?
    - [ ] Explain how you implemented the checklist above step-by-step (not just following the tutorial).
    - [ ] Do you have any feedback for the teaching assistants for Tutorial 2?
- [ ] Access the four URLs in point 2 using Postman, take screenshots of the URL access results in Postman, and add them to your `README.md`.
- [ ] Run `add`-`commit`-`push` to GitHub.
