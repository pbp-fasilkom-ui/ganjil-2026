# Assignment Overview

In this assignment, you will implement the application you've created previously using Flutter based on some of the things you have learned during the tutorial.

**The checklist for this assignment is as follows:**

- [ ] Create a new Flutter application with the same "Football shop" theme as your previous assignments.
- [ ] Create three simple buttons with icons and text for:
  - [ ] All Product
  - [ ] My Products
  - [ ] Create Product
- [ ] Implement different colors for each button:
  - [ ] Blue for the `All Products` button
  - [ ] Green for the `My Products` button
  - [ ] Red for the `Create Product` button
- [ ] Show a `Snackbar` with the text:
  - [ ] "You have pressed the All Products button" when the `All Products` button is pressed.
  - [ ] "You have pressed the My Products button" when the `My Products` button is pressed.
  - [ ] "You have pressed the Create Product button" when the `Create Product` button is pressed.

- [ ] Answer the following questions in the README.md file in your root folder:
  - [ ] Explain what a *widget tree* is in Flutter and how parent-child relationships work between widgets.
  - [ ] List all the *widgets* you used in this project and explain their functions.
  - [ ] What is the function of the `MaterialApp` widget? Explain why this widget is often used as the root widget.
  - [ ] Explain the difference between `StatelessWidget` and `StatefulWidget`. When would you choose one over the other?
  - [ ] What is `BuildContext` and why is it important in Flutter? How is it used in the `build` method?
  - [ ] Explain the concept of a “hot reload” in Flutter and how it differs from a “hot restart”.
- [ ] Run `add`-`commit`-`push` to a new repository on GitHub.
