---

## Assignment Description

In this assignment, you will implement the *Model-View-Template* concept along with other topics you have learned in class and tutorials. Note that the project created for this assignment must be **different** from the project used in the tutorials.

## Application Theme

The main theme of the application for this assignment is a ***Football Shop***. You are free to choose the name and sub-theme of the application. Make your assignment as creative as possible, while ensuring it aligns with the specified theme.

Your application must include the following attributes in its model:

- `name` as the item name with type `CharField`.
- `price` as the item price with type `IntegerField`.
- `description` as the item description with type `TextField`.
- `thumbnail` as the item image with type `URLField`.
- `category` as the item category with type `CharField`.
- `is_featured` as the featured status of the item with type `BooleanField`.

You are welcome to add other attributes if desired, such as `stock`, `rating`, `brand`, etc. However, the model must include the six mandatory attributes listed above (`name`, `price`, `description`, `thumbnail`, `category`, `is_featured`). The names of these attributes can be adjusted to suit your application's needs.

Examples of application ideas you can create:

- *Sigma Sportswear*: `name`, `price`, `description`, `thumbnail`, `rating`, `size`.
- *Garuda Shop*: `name`, `price`, `description`, `thumbnail`, `category`, `stock`.
- Soccer Store: `name`, `price`, `description`, `thumbnail`, `quantity`, `brand`.

## Assignment Checklist

The checklist for this assignment is as follows:

- [ ] Create a new Django project.
- [ ] Create an application named `main` within the project.
- [ ] Configure routing in the project to run the `main` application.
- [ ] Create a model in the `main` application named `Product` with the following mandatory attributes:
    - `name` as the item name with type `CharField`.
    - `price` as the item price with type `IntegerField`.
    - `description` as the item description with type `TextField`.
    - `thumbnail` as the item image with type `URLField`.
    - `category` as the item category with type `CharField`.
    - `is_featured` as the featured status of the item with type `BooleanField`.
- [ ] Create a function in `views.py` to be returned to an HTML *template* that displays the application name, your name, and your class.
- [ ] Create routing in `urls.py` of the `main` application to map the function created in `views.py`.
- [ ] Deploy the application to PWS so that it can be accessed by your peers via the Internet.
- [ ] Create a `README.md` file containing the link to the deployed PWS application and answers to the following questions:
    - Explain how you implemented the checklist above step-by-step (**not just by following the tutorial**).
    - Create a diagram showing the client request to the Django-based web application and its response, and explain the relationship between `urls.py`, `views.py`, `models.py`, and the HTML file in the diagram.
    - Explain the role of `settings.py` in a Django project!
    - How does database migration work in Django?
    - In your opinion, among all existing frameworks, why is the Django framework chosen as the starting point for learning software development?
    - Do you have any feedback for the teaching assistant for Tutorial 1 that you previously completed?
